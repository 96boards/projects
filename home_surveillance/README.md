# Home Surveillance

‘Home Surveillance’ project is aimed at monitoring home using Webcam controlled remotely. 
It also accomplishes facial recognition to identify friendly and unfriendly faces using OpenCV. 
This project spans across multiple domains such as Security, Machine learning, Image processing etc. 
Project is framed as series of steps and is common for all CE boards.

### Part 1 - Introduction to ‘Home Surveillance' using 96Boards

Introduction to the project and explanation of how it is framed. This part mostly consists of a blog
describing the project and its building blocks
